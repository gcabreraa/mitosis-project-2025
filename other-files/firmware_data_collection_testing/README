This has a version of the firmware_main code we are using to run tests on the v1 system
to see how it collects data outside. There are still updates needed to the firmware for
accurate timestamp tracking if we choose to fill up the flash memory with more than just
the 24 samples in the RTC buffer before sending over WiFi

The fuel gauge and IMU code are currently commented out, as the fuel gauge isn't quite
working, and we just want to test for sensor reading functionality with the VEML and SHT40.

Measurements are currently taken every 5 minutes (see SLEEP_TIME_US), and sent once 24
samples are taken (RTC filled), so it posts to the server about every 2 hours.

To download the database from the server, use this command in a terminal:
scp fastapi-user@efpi-21.mit.edu:fastapi-nginx-gunicorn/stata_test_log_041025_night.db path/to/file/on_local

with the password being "password"
